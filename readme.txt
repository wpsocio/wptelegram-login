        // 'corner_radius'   => 15,

## Telegram Web App data

The plugin can also handle the data sent by the [Telegram Web App](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps). Simply send `window.Telegram.WebApp.initData` query string to this URL: 

`http://<your-website.com>/?action=wptelegram_login&source=WebAppData`

The final URL might look like this:

`http://<your-website.com>/?action=wptelegram_login&source=WebAppData&query_id=XXXX&user=XXXX&auth_date=XXXX&hash=XXXX`

The plugin will:

- Validate the data for you
- Create a user account for the user if it doesn't exist
- Login the user to the website in the context of your Web App.

**Note**: You need to use the same bot token for both the plugin and the Web App.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to create a Telegram Bot =

[How do I create a bot?](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#how-do-i-create-a-bot).

= Can I display button more than once on a page =

Sorry, that's not possible because Telegram allows only a single button per page.

= I see "Bot domain invalid" message =

Please follow the instructions given on the WP Telegram Login settings page.

It looks like you missed one that says to send the <code>/setdomain</code> command to @BotFather.

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest way -- WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the plugin:
 
* Log in to your WordPress dashboard
* Navigate to the Plugins menu, and click "Add New"
* In the search field type "wptelegram-login" and hit Enter
* Locate the plugin in the list of search results
* Click on "Install Now" and wait for the installation to complete
* Click on "Activate"

= Manual installation =

Manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The official WordPress documentation contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

== Changelog ==

= 1.10.15 =
- Added php translation files for better performance with WP 6.5
